# Welcome to AnkiLangs!

The aim of this project is to provide high quality
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) (spaced repetition / flashcard software)
decks for learning languages.

This project is not affiliated in any way with Anki nor is it necessarily
endorsed by the Anki team. We do not mean to imply that any language learning
deck must come from this project.

Motivation:

* Many languages decks are unstructured, incomplete or even contain errors
* Collaboration (sending in improvements) is frequently not possible or
  cumbersome (e.g. send an e-mail with suggestions)

Goals:

* Prioritize quality over quantity. Incorrect information or errors are a no
  go.
* Encourage and simplify collaboration to involve many people around the world
  to create and continously improve these decks
* Make the decks a growing project for learning any language of the world
* Create content with permissive open source licenses for easy use and re-use.
